# 3360 Operating Systems Programming Assingments

OS Programming Assignments done for Prof Rincon COSC 3360. The idea for these assignment was to implement a Rate Monolithic Scheduling Diagram through various different ways.

## HW1

The first assignment uses forking to process and print the data.

## HW2

The second assignment involves a client-server model, where the client sends data to the server, where it's processed, then returns it to the client to print.

## HW3

The third assignmnet uses mutex semaphors to produce the Rate Monolithic Scheduling Diagram.
